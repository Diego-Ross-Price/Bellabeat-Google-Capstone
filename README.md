## 📝 Project Summary

This project examines smart device usage data for Bellabeat using the six steps of data analysis: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. The analysis focuses on understanding consumer behavior and trends to help Bellabeat enhance its marketing efforts.

## 🔍 Ask Phase

The project aimed to answer three key questions:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?  
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?  
3. How could these trends influence Bellabeat’s marketing strategy?

To answer these, I reviewed Bellabeat’s products and marketing by exploring the case study, the company’s website, and social media.

- Created calories and steps tables for April and May using Excel pivot tables and tools like "Text to Columns" and "Concatenate."
- Renamed files with a clear naming convention based on data type and date.
- Data processing and analysis conducted in BigQuery using:
  - Excel (data inspection)
  - SQL (processing and aggregation)
  - R (visualization)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Verified date ranges in each file with sorting and visual inspection.
- Used SQL queries to validate data consistency.

---

## 📊 Analyze Phase

## 📈 Share Phase

- Created visualizations primarily using Excel.

## 🎯 Act Phase – Key Insights & Recommendations

1. Users mostly engage in light physical activity — advertising should feature light activities.
2. User activity peaks on weekends, especially Saturdays — ideal for targeted campaigns.
3. Activity is highest in the afternoon — focus advertising during these hours; avoid late night ads.
4. Most users nap once daily and sleep less than 8 hours; no clear link between sleep and activity.
5. Majority fall into normal or overweight categories — focus marketing on these groups.
